# GitHub Actions Typing Catalog

This repository contains type definitions for various GitHub Actions APIs (inputs and outputs). It's best for action
owners to provide the typings themselves and host them from within their repositories (see
[typesafegithub/github-actions-typing](https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-actions-typing)), but if it's
impossible, this repo is a fallback solution.

It uses the same format as in [typesafegithub/github-actions-typing](https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-actions-typing)
to describe the typings.

This repo is to GitHub Actions what [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) is to
TypeScript libraries, [typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed) is to Python ecosystem, or
[SchemaStore](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore) is to JSON.
